# Flango
Flask based GUI for importing data into MongoDB

Flask based app for importing excel and csv ( semicolon or comma as delimiters) using pandas to Mongo database.
Nothing fancy

Flango could be nicely compiled to .exe  by https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/ just needed to add xlrd as hidden import
